              "value": "Whether to get term or permanent life insurance depends on your needs. Term life insurance covers you for a specific period of time, such as 10 or 20 years, and is often more affordable than permanent life insurance. On the other hand, permanent life insurance provides coverage for your whole life and may have a cash value component. To make the right choice, you should talk to a financial advisor or insurance agent."
